# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The Image Filtering Microservice, the final project in course 2 is a Node-Express application which runs a simple script to process images.

## IMPLEMENT A RESTFUL ENDPOINT

```

![depcruise generated graph](./dependencygraph.svg)

1. validates the image_url query
2. calls filterImageFromURL(image_url) to filter the image
3. sends the resulting file in the response
4. deletes any files on the server on finish of the response

- Or, append your own public image url to this link to filter that image
  ```html
  http://cloud-dev-project-2-udagram-image-filte.ap-southeast-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/filteredimage?image_url=
  ```

> Files are deleted manually by making a PUT call to /delete-files end-point. This is so you can view the collection of filtered images before then removing them. Import the following file in Postman.

```terminal
cloud-dev-project-2-udagram-image-filter.postman_collection.json
```
